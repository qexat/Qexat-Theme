# Qexat's theme

ðŸŒ· My personal theme! âœ¨ It matches the style of my [website](https://qexat.com/).

## Install (Visual Studio Code)

1. In the [Releases page](https://github.com/qexat/qexat-theme/releases), download the latest file `qexat-theme-<version>.vsix`.
2. In VS Code, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and start typing [`Extensions: Install from VSIX...`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) until it gets suggested. If this does not work, try using [`Developer: Install Extension from Location...`](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_74#_install-an-extension-located-on-disk).[^1]
3. Choose the previously downloaded file. That should install it automatically.
4. And voilÃ !

[^1]: If the command does not show up, check if VS Code is up to date.
