# Qexat's theme

My personal theme :D

It matches the style of my [website](https://qexat.com/)

## Install

1. In the [Releases page](https://github.com/qexat/qexat-theme/releases), download the latest file `qexat-theme-<version>.vsix`.
2. In Visual Studio Code, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and start typing `Developer: Install Extension from Location...` until it gets suggested.
3. Choose the previously downloaded file. That should install it automatically.
4. And voilÃ !
